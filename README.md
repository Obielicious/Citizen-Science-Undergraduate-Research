## Overview
This repository contains the research poster produced during an NSF-supported undergraduate research project conducted in 2023. The study examined how varying levels of impervious cover affect stream water quality and benthic macroinvertebrate biodiversity across three watersheds in Central Texas.

## Abstract
This project investigates the impacts of stormwater runoff in three watersheds with different ratios of impervious and pervious cover. The goal was to determine whether increased impervious surface area correlates with poorer stream health in the receiving watershed.

The study assessed biodiversity of benthic macroinvertebrates alongside chemical and bacterial indicators of water quality. Because benthic macroinvertebrates vary in their tolerance to pollution, a biotic index was used to evaluate stream health across sampling sites.

Our findings show biotic index scores of **1.73 (Waller Creek)**, **2.0 (Bull Creek)**, and **2.0 (Barton Creek)**—all indicating poor water quality. Pollution-tolerant species observed included leeches, water mites, bloodworms, midge larvae, and Asiatic clams.
